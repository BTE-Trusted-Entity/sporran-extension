## Quick start _with play coins_

1. We recommend using a different browser or a different profile of your browser
   to avoid mixing up the real Sporran and the play coins Sporran
1. Have git, Node.js, and yarn installed
1. `git clone https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sporran-extension.git`
1. `cd sporran-extension`
1. `yarn install && yarn dev`
1. Start Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions (or in Firefox about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)
1. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode (Chrome only)
1. Click the _Load unpacked_ button and select the `sporran-extension/dist` directory
   (or in Firefox click _Load Temporary Add-on..._ and select `sporran-extension/dist/manifest.json`)
1. Now you have the internal version of Sporran installed. **DO NOT USE IT** for real KILT identities/addresses/coins!
   Choose `wss://peregrine.kilt.io/parachain-public-ws` in _âš™ Settings > Custom Endpoint_.
   Click the Sporran icon in the browser toolbar and follow the flow to create an Identity.
   Click the _Receive_ link and copy the Identity address on the next screen.
1. Visit the [Faucet](https://faucet.peregrine.kilt.io/), paste the Identity address there, accept the Terms,
   and click _Request Tokens_ to get some play KILT coins

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to install dependencies and start developing

```


## Build and package for uploading

Update the version in `src/static/manifest.json` and `src/configuration/configuration.ts`.

Run the following commands:

```
yarn install

This will generate a file `dist/web-ext-artifacts/sporran-???.zip` ready to be uploaded to stores.


## Scripts
