## Build and package for uploading

Update the version in `src/static/manifest.json` and `src/configuration/configuration.ts`.

Run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn package
```

This will generate a file `dist/web-ext-artifacts/sporran-???.zip` ready to be uploaded to stores.
